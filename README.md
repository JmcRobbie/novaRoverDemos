# Demo algorithms for the Nova Rover
This is a repo to demonstrate some system control and filtering ideas for an autonomous rover. In general this repo is for concept development and demonstration. 

## Things to note
* Main branch is master, branch from that - and open a pull request once it is developed.

* Git conventions are using "feature/_insert feature name here_"as branch names for features. And "hotfix/_thing being fixed here". 
	* Before merging code make sure that you havent broken anything else in the repo. 

* Follow PEP8 style guide conventions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
